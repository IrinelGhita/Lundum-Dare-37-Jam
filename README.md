	- Camel case naming
	- Method names and parms start with an upper case letter

TODO:
  - <s>Create programming guildelines</s>
  - <s>Choose IDE</s>
  
  
 IDEAS:  
  - Turn based Dungeon Crawler RPG, level changes on trigger
	- You move, then all the enemies move
	- Combat is an automated turn based attack, until an entity dies
	- The level changes after every enemy encounter, or trap triggered
